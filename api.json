      "full": "The Jorōgumo is a spider yokai from Japanese folklore that gains supernatural powers upon reaching 400 years of age. Capable of transforming into a beautiful, seductive woman, the Jorōgumo embodies the archetype of predatory deception—irresistible beauty concealing deadly intent. She lures unsuspecting men to isolated locations such as waterfalls, forests, or caves. Once ensnared by her beauty, charm, and enchanting music, victims are trapped in her supernaturally strong silk threads and devoured. The name translates to \\\"binding bride\\\" or \\\"whore spider,\\\" reflecting her deceptive and predatory nature. Unlike simple monsters, the Jorōgumo is cunning and patient. She may use children as bait, play the biwa (Japanese lute) to attract victims, and maintain elaborate deceptions. In some accounts, she can breathe fire. While appearing as an attractive woman, her true form remains that of a giant spider—and those who discover this truth rarely live to tell of it."
