      "full": "The Jorōgumo is a spider yokai from Japanese folklore that gains supernatural powers upon reaching 400 years of age. Capable of transforming into a beautiful, seductive woman, the Jorōgumo lures unsuspecting men to isolated locations such as waterfalls, forests, or caves. Once ensnared by her beauty and charm, victims are trapped in her silk threads and devoured. The name translates to 'binding bride' or 'whore spider,' reflecting her deceptive and predatory nature. She may use children as bait, play musical instruments like the biwa, and in some accounts, can breathe fire. While appearing as an attractive woman, her true form is that of a giant spider."
